    description:
      'BookMark’d is a transactional marketplace where students can buy and sell their textbooks to other students. On our website, students can sell their new or used textbook at a price they set to have other students buy them directly through the platform. Then, the students can arrange a time to meet and pick-up the items. Our goal is to make the textbook buying process quick and affordable, maybe even helping you earn some extra cash. Win-win for everyone.',

    title: 'Why should I use BookMark’d?',
    description:
      'You get your book FAST (and safely). BookMark’d is designed so students sell their textbooks to other students on campus. All students will have a verified student account, and all textbooks are validated for authenticity, so you can feel safe making a purchase. The nearest student is never more than 15 minutes away, and you can arrange a meeting time on campus that works best for your schedules. You’ll never have to wait in long bookstore lines or pay subscription fees ever again.You can make some extra $$$.You can sell textbooks for whatever price you chose, rather than having to accept a quote that other websites might offer you for reselling. The possibilities are pretty endless. You might meet your future classmate, or maybe your next best friend. Since all transactions are made between students, you’ll have the chance to meet other students on campus. To make the most of your experience, take that chance to build connections with other students, or ask questions about the classes you’re buying books for. You never know who you might meet! ',
